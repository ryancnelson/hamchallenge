# hamchallenge

This repository is the bones of a new (circa april 2024) website by Ryan Nelson (K2RNA, Seattle, WA), that's intended to be:

    * a fun challenge several times a week to set an achievable goal for amateur radio practitioners to accomplish.  These challenge tasks should introduce participants to new people, radio frequency bands, digital modes, practices, hardware, clubs, etc, etc...
    * a community of users and "Elmers using the Socratic method", posing educational questions and experiments that, once worked through, leave the user with more knowledge and experience.
    * a fun "measuring stick" and "points collection contest".  Try to solve at least one challenge per week! Solve 100% for the year!  Claim a badge for helping someone else!  Let's gamify the process of getting into it.  Share your "i finally figured out DSTAR" badge proudly on social media.
    * find other people/stations/resources to communicate with.  There's people to chat with, but there's also radio-mail stations on other continents you can try to connect to, available 24/7.  Send yourself a tweet over APRS.  Find a stranger on the message boards and arrange to transfer SSTV pictures over EchoLink, no radios needed.  Let's brainstorm the possibilities.
