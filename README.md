# hamchallenge

This repository is the bones of a new (circa april 2024) website by Ryan Nelson (K2RNA, Seattle, WA), that's intended to be:

* a fun challenge several times a week to set an achievable goal for amateur radio practitioners to accomplish.  These challenge tasks should introduce participants to new 
    * people
    * radio frequency bands
    * digital modes
    * practices
    * hardware
    * clubs
    * etc, etc...
* a community of users and "Elmers using the Socratic method", posing educational questions and experiments that, once worked through, leave the user with more knowledge and experience.  
* a fun "measuring stick" and "points collection contest".  Let's game-ify the process of getting into it.  
    * Try to solve at least one challenge per week!
    * Solve 100% for the year!  
    * Claim a badge for helping someone else!
    * Share your "i finally figured out DSTAR" badge proudly on social media.
* find other people/stations/resources to communicate with. Let's brainstorm the possibilities.
    * There's people to chat with, but, 
    * there's also radio-mail stations on other continents you can try to connect to, available 24/7.
    * Send yourself a tweet over APRS.
    * Map out what WSPR beacons you can hear on the various bands during daylight vs. night
    * Find a stranger on the message boards and arrange to transfer SSTV pictures over EchoLink, no radios needed.  


**Here's ChatGPT's first swing at some ideas:**

```suggest a list of ten interesting, educational tasks that a ham radio user could perform that would progress their experience in using amateur radio digital modes.```

Certainly! Here are ten educational tasks that a ham radio operator could undertake to enhance their experience with digital modes in amateur radio:
- Set Up a Digital Mode Workstation: Start by setting up a digital mode workstation, including the necessary software (such as WSJT-X, Fldigi, or JTDX), a sound card interface, and connecting your transceiver to your computer. This will familiarize you with the basic requirements for operating digital modes.

- Decode PSK31 Conversations: PSK31 is a popular and efficient digital mode for text communication. Practice tuning into PSK31 frequencies and using software to decode conversations. This will help you understand how to adjust your setup for clear reception and transmission.

- Make a QSO Using FT8: FT8 is a fast-growing digital mode known for its weak-signal performance. Try making a contact (QSO) using FT8, which will teach you about timing, frequency selection, and automated communication protocols.

- Experiment with Slow Scan TV (SSTV): Transmit and receive images using SSTV modes. This will give you experience with a different aspect of digital communication and the nuances of sending visual data over the airwaves.

- Participate in a Digital Mode Net: Check for scheduled digital nets and participate in one. This will help you learn net protocols, improve your digital communication skills, and allow you to interact with other digital mode enthusiasts.

- Explore Digital Mobile Radio (DMR): If you have a DMR-capable radio, program it to access local repeaters or hotspots. This will introduce you to the world of digital voice communication and the use of talk groups and time slots.

- Try Out Winlink for Email Over Radio: Set up Winlink and send an email over radio waves. This task will teach you about radio email communication and how to operate when traditional internet services are unavailable.

- Operate in a Digital Contest: Participate in a digital mode-specific contest, such as the RTTY Roundup or the FT8 DX Contest. This will improve your operating speed, frequency agility, and logging accuracy under competitive conditions.

- Use APRS for Real-Time Position Reporting: Configure your station for Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS) usage. This will help you understand packet radio and how it can be used for real-time position reporting and messaging.

- Experiment with Weak Signal Propagation Reporter (WSPR): Set up your station to transmit or receive WSPR signals. This mode is designed for probing potential propagation paths with low-power transmissions. It will give you insights into propagation conditions and antenna performance.

Each of these tasks will help you gain proficiency in different aspects of digital modes in amateur radio, from basic operation to more advanced applications. Remember to always operate within your license privileges and adhere to the regulations of your country's amateur radio governing body.
